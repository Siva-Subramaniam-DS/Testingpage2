        <h2 className="section-title">Benefits of Using Solar Panels at Home</h2>
        <ul className="benefits-list">
          <li>Reduced Electricity Bills – Generate your own electricity from sunlight, leading to substantial savings on your energy bills.</li>
          <li>Energy Independence – Produce your own electricity, enhancing energy security and reducing vulnerability to outages and fluctuating prices.</li>
          <li>Environmental Impact – Solar energy is a clean, renewable resource that reduces your carbon footprint by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
          <li>Increased Property Value – Homes equipped with solar panels often see an appreciation in property value due to lower energy costs and sustainable living.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="section-title">Strategies to Save Electricity</h2>
        <ul className="strategies-list">
          <li>Energy-Efficient Appliances – Upgrade to appliances with high energy efficiency ratings to reduce electricity consumption.</li>
          <li>Smart Energy Practices – Implement habits such as turning off lights when not in use, unplugging devices, and using programmable thermostats.</li>
          <li>Home Insulation – Proper insulation minimizes the need for excessive heating or cooling, leading to energy conservation.</li>
          <li>Solar Battery Storage – Integrate battery storage with your solar panels to store excess energy generated during the day for use during peak hours or at night.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="section-title">Integrating Electric Vehicles (EVs) in Tamil Nadu</h2>
        <p>Integrating electric vehicles (EVs) into daily life in Tamil Nadu offers both environmental and economic advantages. To optimize electricity consumption for EV cars and bikes in the region, consider the following strategies:</p>
        <ol className="ev-strategies-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Home Charging with Solar Energy</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Leverage Government Subsidies – Tamil Nadu's Chief Minister's Solar Rooftop Capital Incentive Scheme provides a capital subsidy of ₹20,000 per kilowatt for grid-connected domestic solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, complementing the 30% subsidy from the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE).</li>
              <li>Net Metering Benefits – By installing a solar PV system, you can utilize net metering to feed excess electricity back into the grid, effectively reducing your electricity bills and offsetting the energy consumed while charging your EV.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Utilize Public Charging Infrastructure</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Expanding Charging Network – The Tamil Nadu government plans to increase the number of charging stations from approximately 400 to 2,000 by the end of FY2025, enhancing accessibility for EV users across the state.</li>
              <li>City Initiatives – Cities like Chennai, Coimbatore, Madurai, and Trichy are witnessing the installation of public and private EV charging stations to meet the growing demand, providing more options for EV owners to charge their vehicles conveniently.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Adopt Energy-Efficient Charging Practices</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Optimal Charging Levels – Regularly charging your EV battery to around 80% rather than a full 100% can prolong battery life and improve efficiency. Many EVs allow you to set a target charge level to manage this.</li>
              <li>Avoid Deep Discharges – Maintaining the battery charge between 20% and 80% helps prevent deep discharges, which can degrade battery health over time.</li>
              <li>Use Fast Charging Sparingly – While convenient, frequent use of fast charging can generate additional heat, which may affect battery longevity. It's advisable to use fast charging primarily when necessary, such as during long trips.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Supportive Policies and Incentives</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Tamil Nadu Electric Vehicle Policy 2023 – The state aims to attract significant investments in EV manufacturing and charging infrastructure, offering various concessions and incentives to promote EV adoption.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </section>
